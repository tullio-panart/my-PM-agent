This directory contains portable workflow exports for the local AI agent.

| `workflows/11-setup-sync-enabled-skills.json` | Validates and stores the enabled Markdown skill bundle through a temporary local endpoint |
| `workflows/20-tool-list-tasks.json` | Validates filters, reads factual task rows, and audits the read |
| `workflows/21-tool-create-task.json` | Idempotently creates one task when called by the confirmation dispatcher |
| `workflows/22-tool-update-task-status.json` | Changes only one task status when called by the confirmation dispatcher |

The workflow exports contain a credential reference named `Anthropic account`, but no API key. After import, create or select a real Anthropic credential inside n8n.

Use the repository import script rather than editing JSON by hand:

```bash
./scripts/import-workflows.sh
```

Workflow setup and testing are documented in [N8N_AGENT_SETUP.md](../docs/N8N_AGENT_SETUP.md). The task schema and extension rules are in [LOCAL_TASK_TOOLS.md](../docs/LOCAL_TASK_TOOLS.md); skills and confirmation are covered by [CUSTOMISE_SKILLS.md](../docs/CUSTOMISE_SKILLS.md) and [SAFE_WRITE_CONFIRMATION.md](../docs/SAFE_WRITE_CONFIRMATION.md). Technical contributors should use [WORKFLOW_DEVELOPMENT.md](../docs/WORKFLOW_DEVELOPMENT.md) when moving a visual edit back into Git.
